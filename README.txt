
## 🎉 TASK #3: Fun and Fabulous Challenges! 🎉

### 🌟 Challenge 1: Magical Months 🌟
Create a magical program that asks you for a number from 1 to 12. Then, like a wizard with a calendar spell, it will reveal the name of the month that matches your number. Don’t forget to add a default case for those cheeky numbers that aren’t between 1 and 12!

### 🌀 Challenge 2: Even or Odd Odyssey 🌀
Embark on an odyssey to determine the nature of your number! This program will ask you for a number and then, with a bit of mathematical magic, it will tell you if your number is an even warrior or an odd wanderer.

### 🚗 Challenge 3: Parking Price Party 🚗
Time to calculate the cost of your parking adventure! This program will ask you how long you’ve been parked at the shopping center and then compute your parking fee based on this fun pricing scheme:
- 🕒 First 60 minutes: $5.00
- ⏳ First 2 hours: $15.00
- ⌛️ 2 hours and onwards: $40.00
